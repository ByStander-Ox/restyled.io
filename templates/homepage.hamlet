  <p>Nudge your team towards consistent coding style with every PR

    <strong>Style is important</strong>. Any time there's more than one way to
    do something in code, inconsistencies will creep in. Besides measurably
    adding to the time it takes to read and comprehend code, inconsistent style
    across a code base can hide bugs, often

    <a href=#>bad
    <a href=#>ones</a>.

  <p>
    Many automated tools exist to automatically align code to a defined style. A
    solo developer could wire up their preferred tools with a git pre-commit
    hook to ensure code is consistent before committing, but doing this across a
    team can be challenging. Restyled aims to make it easier to transition a
    team to a consistent coding style automatically through their normal Pull
    Request flow.

  <h2>How it works
  <p>
    Restyled listens for Pull Requests opened against your projects. It then
    runs one or more of your preferred automated formatters. If differences are
    found, it opens a sibling PR and comments with a link to it. Members of your
    team can clearly see any style violations in the diff, and have the option
    to incorporate those changes with a simple click of the Merge button.
